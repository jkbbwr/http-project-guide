## Intro

Welcome to the TPH first guided project!
The goal of this event is to help guide you through the steps of building a self contained project.

The supported languages for this project are

- Python
- C
- C++ 
- Rust
- Java
- Kotlin
- Javascript

This project will expect you to have basic understanding of the language you are using and have a few extra tools 
installed like; `git` 

[//]: <> (Other tools here)

This project will guide you in the direction of what you need to do but it leaves individual learning up to you.
Feel free to ask for help, search topics online, look for tutorials for any of the concepts presented.

The idea is to guide you along but not give you all the answers.

[//]: <> (Feel free to tack more languages on.)

## Rules
